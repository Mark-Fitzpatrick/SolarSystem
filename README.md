Solar System Feat of Strength 

My implementation of the Solar System is in 3D and runs in a Google Chrome 
web browser.  I developed the code on my MacBook Pro, but it should also work
on various flavors of Unix provided a current version of the Google Chrome web
browser is installed.  In particular, I was using Google Chrome Version 63.0.3239.132 (Official Build) (64-bit).


The planets look good on my 23.5 inch (1920 x 1080) monitor.

The source is organized as follows:

/SolarSystem contains this README.md file and two subdirectories:
 FoS and libs.

/SolarSystem/FoS contains planet_model.js and planets.html

/SolarSystem/libs contains the necessary libs for working with
WebGL and three.js



To start, copy the SolarSystem directory and its content to a convenient
place on your computer, such as the Desktop.

Start your Chrome Browser, and open the file planets.html from the
/SolarSystem/FoS directory.



Design Features
===============

I modeled the planets orbits around the sun using elliptical orbits.
The file planet_model.js contains the model code.  The view and controller
code is defined in planets.html.  The controls include a slider on the
top right hand side of the screen for specifying the speed of the orbits,
and a reverse checkbox, which causes the planets to revolve backwards in
time when checked.

You should notice that each planet is drawn to scale and using good colors.  
However, the size of the Sun compared to the planets is inaccurate but
necessary in order not to waste too much screen real estate for the Sun alone.

Distances are to scale, based on astronimical units.

I was able to verify my computations by comparing output against examples from
Computing planetary positions - a tutorial with worked examples using the 
reference date of -3543, which is 19 April 1990.
